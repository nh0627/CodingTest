What is functional programming?
======================

In OOP, a class is divided up properties and methods. 

Functional programming has the idea as well of separating concerns but they also separate data and functions.

Most functional programming languages don't have these concepts of classes and methods that belong to objects,

instead functions operate on well-defined data structures like arrays and objects rather than actually belonging to that data structure like an object (keep it stateless).
